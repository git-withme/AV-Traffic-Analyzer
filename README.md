✅ Project Title:
AV-Traffic-Analyzer

✅ Objective:
To predict and visualize urban traffic flow patterns using:Autonomous Vehicle (AV) data, Smart Traffic Signal status, Historical traffic count information
This helps smart cities manage congestion and optimize traffic signals effectively.

✅ Problem Statement:
1.Traditional traffic prediction systems do not consider Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) or smart signal timing.
2.Growing AV usage in smart cities changes traffic patterns.
3.Existing systems may lack real-time visualization and downloadable analytics.

✅ Features:
1.Traffic flow forecasting using ARIMA and LSTM models
2.Comparison between AV traffic and regular vehicle traffic
3.Smart signal status pie chart
4.Interactive date range filter

✅ Future Scope:
1.Integrate live traffic APIs for real-time city traffic feeds
2.Add congestion alert systems based on predicted values
3.Implement carbon footprint estimation linked to AV efficiency
Deploy as a full web application (hosted online)
Support Reinforcement Learning-based signal optimization

✅ Conclusion:
The AV-Enabled Urban Traffic Analyzer is a future-ready smart city solution. It helps predict and analyze traffic patterns by incorporating modern data types like AV counts and smart traffic signals. This project demonstrates how time series forecasting can support city planners and traffic management systems in creating safer, more efficient urban environments.
